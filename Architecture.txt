1. Front-End Hosting:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Function: Hosts the static files of the front-end application, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
Usage: S3 is highly scalable and durable, making it ideal for serving static assets.
Deployment: The static files are uploaded to an S3 bucket that serves as the hosting for your front-end.
Amazon CloudFront:
Function: Distributes the static content stored in S3 across the globe to users.
Usage: By using CloudFront, content is cached at edge locations, reducing latency and delivering the content faster to end-users.
Benefit: This enables low-latency access for users regardless of their geographical location.
Amazon Route 53:
Function: Provides DNS (Domain Name System) routing.
Usage: Route 53 resolves domain names (e.g., www.yoursite.com) to the CloudFront distribution.
Benefit: It ensures users are directed to the correct CloudFront distribution, improving routing reliability.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
Function: Manages SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections.
Usage: It ensures that the data between users and CloudFront is encrypted via HTTPS.
Benefit: SSL/TLS certificates are automatically provisioned, deployed, and renewed by ACM, simplifying security management.

2. Backend API:
This section contains the serverless backend logic and API for interacting with your application.
Amazon API Gateway:
Function: Exposes a RESTful API to users (or other services) to interact with the back-end system.
Usage: API Gateway serves as the entry point for incoming API requests.
Benefit: It handles request routing, authorization, traffic management, and monitoring for the APIs.
AWS Lambda:
Function: Executes backend logic in a serverless manner, triggered by API Gateway requests.
Usage: The backend code runs in Lambda functions, which are event-driven and scale automatically.
Benefit: Lambda abstracts away infrastructure management, reducing overhead and scaling automatically based on demand.
Amazon Cognito:
Function: Provides user authentication and access control.
Usage: Cognito allows users to sign up, sign in, and access resources securely using OAuth, SAML, or custom authentication mechanisms.
Benefit: It integrates seamlessly with API Gateway and Lambda, simplifying user management.

3. Database Layer:
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):
Function: A fully managed relational database (either MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store structured data.
Usage: The backend services (Lambda functions) interact with the RDS database to read/write data.
Benefit: RDS takes care of database management tasks such as patching, backups, and replication, allowing you to focus on the application.
Multi-AZ Deployment:
Function: RDS is deployed in multiple availability zones (AZs) for high availability.
Usage: In case of a failure in one AZ, RDS automatically switches to another AZ.
Benefit: This provides automatic failover and ensures high availability for your database.

4. Networking and Security:
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
Function: VPC is a logically isolated network within AWS where your resources reside.
Usage: All the AWS services in the architecture are placed within this VPC for controlled network traffic.
Benefit: You can control IP address ranges, subnets, routing tables, and network gateways for better security and resource isolation.
Public Subnets: Used for resources that must be publicly accessible, such as NAT Gateways.
Usage: Public subnets allow outbound traffic to the internet but do not directly expose services like the database or Lambda to the internet.
Private Subnets: Used for internal resources like Lambda functions and the RDS database.
Usage: Resources in private subnets cannot be accessed directly from the internet. They can only interact with publicly accessible resources (like API Gateway) through secure routes.


IAM Roles (Identity and Access Management):
Function: IAM manages access control to AWS resources.
Usage: Lambda functions, RDS, and other services are assigned IAM roles with the required permissions to access AWS services securely.
Benefit: Fine-grained access control ensures that only authorized services and users can access your resources.
KMS (Key Management Service):
Function: Manages encryption keys to protect data at rest.
Usage: Sensitive data stored in services like RDS, S3, and Lambda can be encrypted using KMS.
Benefit: KMS provides centralized control over your encryption keys for security and compliance.

5. CI/CD Pipeline:
AWS CodePipeline:
Function: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying your application.
Usage: CodePipeline manages the flow from code changes to deployment, integrating with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy for continuous integration and deployment.
Benefit: It automates the application release process, reducing manual intervention and speeding up the deployment cycle.
AWS CodeBuild:
Function: Builds the front-end and tests the back-end code.
Usage: CodeBuild compiles the source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts (such as a packaged front-end to be deployed to S3 or Lambda deployment packages).
Benefit: CodeBuild scales automatically to handle multiple build requests.
AWS CodeDeploy:
Function: Deploys the front-end to S3 and updates Lambda functions.
Usage: CodeDeploy takes the build artifacts from CodeBuild and deploys them to the appropriate AWS service, ensuring that the right version is deployed to production.
Benefit: CodeDeploy automates deployments, reducing the chance of human error.

6. Monitoring and Logging:
This section provides observability and tracking for the applicationâ€™s behavior.
CloudWatch:
Function: Provides logging, monitoring, and alarms for all AWS services.
Usage: CloudWatch collects logs and metrics from Lambda, API Gateway, and other AWS services, allowing you to monitor application health and troubleshoot issues.
Benefit: CloudWatch helps ensure application reliability and uptime by tracking performance metrics, errors, and other critical data.
X-Ray:
Function: Provides tracing for requests that pass through various services.
Usage: X-Ray traces the flow of requests through API Gateway, Lambda, and other components, helping identify performance bottlenecks or failures.
Benefit: X-Ray helps with debugging and optimizing the performance of the backend.
CloudTrail:
Function: Logs all API calls made within your AWS account for auditing purposes.
Usage: CloudTrail captures details of all AWS API interactions, allowing you to track who did what, when, and from where.
Benefit: CloudTrail is essential for security, compliance, and troubleshooting by providing a complete history of AWS API activity.

Note: We can use prometheus and grafana as well for monitoring, logging and creating alarms.
